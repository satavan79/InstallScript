Odoo Install Script
This script is based on the install script from André Schenkels (https://github.com/aschenkels-ictstudio/openerp-install-scripts) but goes a bit further and has been improved. This script will also give you the ability to define an xmlrpc_port in the .conf file that is generated under /etc/ This script can be safely used in a multi-odoo code base server because the default Odoo port is changed BEFORE the Odoo is started.

Installing Nginx
If you set the parameter INSTALL_NGINX to True you should also configure workers. Without workers you will probably get connection loss issues. Look at the deployment guide from Odoo on how to configure workers.

Installation procedure
1. Download the script:
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yenthe666/InstallScript/16.0/odoo_install.sh
2. Modify the parameters as you wish.
There are a few things you can configure, this is the most used list:
OE_USER will be the username for the system user.
GENERATE_RANDOM_PASSWORD if this is set to True the script will generate a random password, if set to Falsewe'll set the password that is configured in OE_SUPERADMIN. By default the value is True and the script will generate a random and secure password.
INSTALL_WKHTMLTOPDF set to False if you do not want to install Wkhtmltopdf, if you want to install it you should set it to True.
OE_PORT is the port where Odoo should run on, for example 8069.
OE_VERSION is the Odoo version to install, for example 16.0 for Odoo V16.
IS_ENTERPRISE will install the Enterprise version on top of 16.0 if you set it to True, set it to False if you want the community version of Odoo 16.
OE_SUPERADMIN is the master password for this Odoo installation.
INSTALL_NGINX is set to False by default. Set this to True if you want to install Nginx.
WEBSITE_NAME Set the website name here for nginx configuration
ENABLE_SSL Set this to True to install certbot and configure nginx with https using a free Let's Encrypted certificate
ADMIN_EMAIL Email is needed to register for Let's Encrypt registration. Replace the default placeholder with an email of your organisation.
INSTALL_NGINX and ENABLE_SSL must be set to True and the placeholder in ADMIN_EMAIL must be replaced with a valid email address for certbot installation
By enabling SSL though Let's Encrypt you agree to the following policies

3. Make the script executable
sudo chmod +x odoo_install.sh
4. Execute the script:
sudo ./odoo_install.sh
Where should I host Odoo?
There are plenty of great services that offer good hosting. The script has been tested with a few major players such as Google Cloud, Hetzner, Amazon AWS and DigitalOcean. If you'd like you can use my DigitalOcean referral link which gives you a 200$ voucher for free for the first 60 days.

Minimal server requirements
While technically you can run an Odoo instance on 1GB (1024MB) of RAM it is absolutely not advised. A Linux instance typically uses 300MB-500MB and the rest has to be split among Odoo, postgreSQL and others. If you install an Odoo you should make sure to use at least 2GB of RAM. This script might fail with less resources too. There are known issues on DigitalOcean for example where the installation crashes on 1GB RAM machines. See #243
